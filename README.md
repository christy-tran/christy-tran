<h3>Why Did I Switch to Tech/Programming? :desktop_computer:</h3>

<p>After graduating with my B.S. in Biology, I was preparing for a medical career when I quickly realized: I have always had a love and appreciation for technology. </p>

<p>As a child, I loved playing on my laptop and desktop, taking apart random gadgets before putting them back together with my dad, playing games with my friends, keeping up with the latest consoles, customizing my Xanga, Myspace, and Tumblr profiles, and reveling over new innovations that had the thinnest and sleekest designs. I just never really imagined my hobby and interest as my career—until now.</p>

<p>Perhaps a catalyst to discovering my passion for programming was when my dad needed a new software for his small business. The previous system he had in place was not backed up properly, so he lost everything when his computer crashed, rendering him to do everything by paper. When
he could not afford to hire a company, he asked me to find a friend that could help us, which was difficult as everyone I knew was busy with their new careers. As I listened to the things he needed for the software, it sounded so simple that I became frustrated for not being able to just do it myself. I began researching solutions  to create a basic version of what he needed before my brother’s developer friend found out about his predicament and created it for him on the spot.</p>

<p>My dad’s needs were finally met, but I was left with a revelation and hunger bubbling deep inside me—I never want to feel so helpless again; I want to be able to create things and solve problems on my own to help myself and others in need. :heartpulse:</p>

<!-- <p>As I learn fundamental web development concepts and explore the GitHub community, the amount of teamwork and collaboration I’ve witnessed has truly fascinated me. I’m currently a bit of a lurker in this large community, but I hope to grow into a more helpful member with each day!</p> -->
